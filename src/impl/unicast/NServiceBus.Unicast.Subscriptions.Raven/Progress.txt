- Build via NAnt script which fixed a lot of the missing references.
- Fixed Raven references, seems it should have been referenceing Raven.Embedded, to which the path needed to be fixed and the namespaces changed, mainly from Raven.Client to Raven.Embedded.Client.
- Also had to fix some code it now compiles but tests are failing
