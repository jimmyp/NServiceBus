- Build via NAnt script which fixed a lot of the missing references.
- Seems there are still some external binaries missing though, most noticably:
	- log4net, this is in the lib folder so why is it not being found
	- *some* and not other Raven assemblies, again this is strange as I would assume that they all get pulled in by NuGet as part of the build script.
